### A Concise System For 34 Keys
===============================================

All the normal functionalty a general user would need, all packaged intelligenty into five easy to navigate layers:

* Layer 0: Base layer (QWERTY)
* Layer 1: Symbols
* Layer 2: Numpad and Function Keys
* Layer 3: Navigation (includes all mouse functionality)
* Layer 4: Macros (with many placholders for expansion)

The thumb keys hold the power to activate higher layers by holding them down, as well as locking them by tapping both on either side as a combo.  That way you don't have to hold a key down to use the layer for more involved operations.  This system is illustrated in the last diagram below.
