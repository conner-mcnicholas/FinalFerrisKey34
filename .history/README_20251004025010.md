### A Concise System For 34 Keys
===============================================

All the normal functionalty a general user would need, all packaged intelligenty into five easy to navigate layers:

* Layer 0: Base layer (QWERTY)
* Layer 1: Symbols
* Layer 2: Numpad and Useful* Function Keys
* Layer 3: Navigation (includes all mouse functionality)
* Layer 4: Macros (with many placholders for expansion)

The thumb keys hold the power to activate higher layers by holding them down, as well as locking them by tapping both on either side as a combo.  That way you don't have to hold a key down to use the layer for more involved operations.  This system is illustrated in the last diagram below.

*The function keys on layer 2 exclude the useless ones, replacing them with more critical operations. Most importantly, to accomodate Bootloader Mode and direction keys, as having that on the left hand side allows you to flash each side of the split ergo seperately while having control of command line history from either half (when the right half is plugged in by itself to be flashed, it operates as a mirror image of the left half).
