### A Minimalist Solution for 34 Keys
===============================================

All the functionality of a full sized keyboard contained in 34 keys spanning five intuitive layers:

1. **Initial Load**: is a simple ingestion of all available details and fatalities csv.gz files.  
    - "one and done", i.e. nothing to cleanup or monitor.
2. **Monthly Update**: On the 16th of each month, the current year's file is updated and renamed with mod date
    - upon confirmation of that filename change, trigger **upd** ELT pipeline  
3. **Yearly New**: On April 16th of each year, a fresh file for that year is dropped for the first time.  
    - Upon confirmation of that new file drop, trigger **new** ELT pipeline
0. QWERTY:  Thumbs â†’ Esc+Space (L) / Backspace+Enter (R) 
1. SYMBOLS:     All standard plus select unicode
2. SPECIAL:     Functions (L) / Numpad (R)
3. NAVIGATION:  Scroll Wheel (L) / Mouse + D-pad (R)
4. MACROS:      Cursor Enclosures (L) / Misc (R) 

The thumb keys hold the power to activate higher layers by holding them down, as well as locking them by tapping both on either side as a combo. That way you don't have to hold a key down to use the layer for more involved operations. This system is illustrated in the last diagram below.

*The function keys on layer 2 exclude the useless ones, replacing them with more critical operations. Notably, it is good to have Bootloader Mode and direction keys on the left hand side, as that allows you to flash each side of the split ergo independently using command line history in QMK (when the right half is plugged in by itself to be flashed, it operates as a mirror image of the left half).
